# GPT 2022

## Project Description

GPT 2022 is a GPT 3.5-turbo Chatbot with knowledge of 2022 events. It uses retrieval-augmented generation on relevant documents (e.g 2022 annual reports) to fetch top-k similar chunks as context for user queries. Features include QA (question-answering), chat memory (remembering conversations), multi-doc fetch (fetching from multiple sources), and citations. Citations provide page number and excerpt!
